            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The New York City Department of Buildings (NYCDOB) announced in September 2020, that it will implement a building energy efficiency rating that will require all New York City buildings 25,000 square feet or larger to post an energy-efficient letter grade sign at their entrances. The letter grade assignments are a feature of the Climate Mobilization Act, otherwise known as Local Law 97. This ambitious initiative requires buildings 25,000 square feet or larger to reduce their carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030, and by 80 percent by 2050. The Department of Buildings will begin enforcing these carbon caps in 2024.</p>

        <section id="methodology">
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>The building energy efficiency rating is based on the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) online benchmarking tool, called the Energy Star Portfolio Manager. It is an online tool that is used to measure energy, water consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions. The tool can be used for one building or several buildings. 

                According to the guidelines set out by the NYC Department of Buildings at NYC.gov:
                
                An energy efficiency score is the Energy Star Rating that a building earns using the United States Environmental Protection Agency online benchmarking tool, Energy Star Portfolio Manager, to compare building energy performance to similar buildings in similar climates. </p>

        <section id="Scope">
            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <p>Statistically, this legislation will affect around 50,000 buildings in New York City and nearly 60 percent of the city’s building area, according to the Urban Green Council Local Law 97 summary. The summary also states that buildings are responsible for two-thirds of New York City’s annual emissions, with the other third coming primarily from on the road transportation. This has a substantial impact on energy production. 

                The level of transparency offered by the building energy efficiency rating will show the energy efficiency or inefficiency of a building. The New York City Council Climate Mobilization Act has identified that buildings emit different amounts of greenhouse gases, depending on their usage. The top 5 building types, greater than 50,000 square feet, are: Residential (36%), Business (26%), Institutional (12%), Hospital (7%), and Education (7%). Although in terms of average greenhouse gas emission intensity by use, for buildings greater than 25,000 square feet, hospitals emit the most greenhouse gasses per square foot. Hospitals use energy-intensive system such as ventilation, required by law for constant airflow.  Coupled with other energy-intensive devices, including MRI machines and ventilators, cause an increase in emissions. </p>
