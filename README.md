# 2022-NYC's Building Energy Efficiency Rating

## Project Overview
This project is part of an ongoing effort for the NYU Web Mapping class, focusing on visualizing the energy efficiency ratings of buildings across New York City. The aim is to provide a user-friendly web map that allows users to see energy efficiency data at a glance, offering insights into where improvements can be made.

## Current Status
- **Current Version**: Displays 27 buildings.
- **Accuracy**: Some positions of BBL (Borough Block Lot) may be incorrect due to data conversion challenges.
- **Data Processing**: Data is being converted from PDFs to Excel sheets, then to JSON format. Additionally, there is an ongoing effort to convert BBL data to accurate geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) or possibly to upgrade to building zone-specific data.

## Challenges Faced
- **Data Conversion**: One of the primary challenges has been converting the data accurately from PDFs to a usable digital format. Ensuring the integrity of the data during this process has been both time-consuming and technically demanding.
- **Geocoding**: Translating BBL data into precise geographic coordinates has presented significant difficulties, as discrepancies in data have led to inaccuracies in the mapped locations.
- **Web Mapping**: Integrating the data into a functional and interactive web map involves numerous technical aspects, from backend data handling to frontend user interface design, each with its own set of challenges.

## Motivation
My interest in this project stems from a commitment to promoting sustainable building practices. By making energy efficiency data accessible and understandable, I hope to encourage building owners and tenants to invest in energy-saving measures. This project not only helps in academic learning but also contributes to environmental sustainability by highlighting areas for energy efficiency improvements.

## Future Goals
- **Expand Data Coverage**: Increase the number of buildings represented in the map.
- **Improve Data Accuracy**: Enhance the precision of the location data.
- **User Interaction**: Develop more interactive features that allow users to query specific data points and receive detailed information on building energy performance.
